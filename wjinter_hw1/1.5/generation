To answer "Why is C++ called C++ and not ++C?", I would like to disclose the background knowledge.

In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup began work on "C with Classes", the predecessor to C++. The "C with classes" was then
renamed to C++ since C++ was the genius development from C. C++ was not created independently from C like Pascal
in the 70s. Both "C with Classes" and C were designed to be general-purpose programming language. Pascal did firstly
appeared in the 70s. However, Pascal is not a general-purpose programming language as C. However, "C with Classes" added
"adding new features that included virtual functions, function name and operator overloading, references, constants,
type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type checking, and BCPL style single-line comments
with two forward slashes (//). Furthermore, it included the development of a standalone compiler for C++."

Furthermore, syntaxically, x++ means x++ is post-increment of 1 to x and ++x means ++x is post-increment of 1 to x.
For example: let x = C++, then x is equal to the value of C AFTER the increment/improvement in above words operation is done. where as
             let x = ++C, then x is equal to the value of C BEFORE the increment/improvement in above words operation is done.

Computer syntax, in essence, captures abstraction of logical/real world. Since in CS, syntactic ordering matter a lot as
chronological ordering. And since Bjarne Stroustrup is a computer scientists and be in the arena of the world created
by the computer scientists. It is nature  Bjarne Stroustrup would follow with the syntaxtic order and the abstraction
from the real world in the 70s, the unique close relationship between "C with classes" and C to call C++ not ++C.
